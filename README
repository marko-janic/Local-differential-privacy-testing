## Local Differential Privacy Testing
We test different local differential privacy mechanisms on a CDC dataset about Diabetes health indicators (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators).

Algorithm parameters can be adjusted in the functions themselves under the algorithms folder and then in the respective algorithm file.
